### Description

This enhanced web infrastructure represents an evolved version of the previously detailed setup, found in [this document](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure.md). In this iteration, all Single Points Of Failure (SPOFs) have been eliminated. Key components, namely the web, application, and database servers, now independently operate on separate GNU/Linux servers. SSL protection extends beyond the load-balancer, with each server's network fortified by firewalls and subject to continuous monitoring.

### Infrastructure Enhancements

- **Dedicated Firewalls for Each Server**: Individual firewalls for each server enhance security, shielding against unauthorized access and undesirable traffic for each component, as opposed to a singular point of defense.
